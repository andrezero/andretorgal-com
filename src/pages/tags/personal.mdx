<Abstract>

Some of the stuff on this site is _quite personal_.

</Abstract>

I have no problems with publishing it online, just as I have been doing since my [early blogging days](/meta/project/archaeology). I am just trying to establish a meaningful connection with other humans beings, even if there is a chance that only :robot_face: machines are reading it...

But hey! :wave: Here you are! Is it possible you are human as well? I can imagine you reading this many years after I wrote it. Will I ever hear back from you?

Cheers!
