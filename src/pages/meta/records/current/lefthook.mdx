<Abstract>

I want the git hook feedback loops, but I definitely don't want to bring Husky into the package dependencies.

</Abstract>

## Why?

Husky was great but it's getting a bit out of hand. Needs a replacement.

It's easy to find people that agree with this: [Alternatives to Husky](https://www.reddit.com/r/node/comments/mgaa3a/alternative_to_husky/).

## Decision: use [Lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook)

- fast! written in Go :notbad:
- maintained: 56 contributors, steady code frequency
- great docs
- :dizzy_face: `yml` config
- :yum: run commands in parallel.

## Other options considered

### Just `git-hooks`

Possibly. See [no need for Husky](https://dev.to/krzysztofkaczy9/do-you-really-need-husky-247b)

But on the other I also don't need:

```
RED="\033[1;31m"
GREEN="\033[1;32m"
NC="\033[0m"
linter_exit_code=1
all_ts_files=$(git diff --cached --
```

### [Simple Git hooks](https://github.com/toplenboren/simple-git-hooks)

- popular! used by 6K
- :unamused: built in 2021 but stale
- :thumbsup: simple config, `json`, `js`, or `cjs`
- limited:
  - requires you to manually apply the changes to git hooks.
  - only one command per git hook.
