<Abstract>

I have been using Markdown to store my websites content for a while. Actually, I have been using forever to organise my life, especially work. Can I keep using it now with [React Static](/meta/records/rejected/react-static)?

</Abstract>

## Status :x: Replaced

Replaced by [Astro](/meta/records/current/build-with-astro) which pre-packages [Markdown](/tags/markdown) and [MDX](/tags/mdx) capabilities.

**Note**: 4 years later I eventually wrote a blog post to celebrate [how big and relevant Unified.js has become](/src/pages/posts/2023-01/unified-js-is-going-to-be-around-for-a-long-time.md)

## Why

- modular library, many plugins
- transforms to React
- works in both directions
- complete [working implementation](https://github.com/s-thom/website/blob/develop/src/components/MdRenderer/index.tsx)

## Trade-offs

- not written in typescript and no typings supplied for many plugins
- incomplete/inconsistent docs
- many repos, different authors
