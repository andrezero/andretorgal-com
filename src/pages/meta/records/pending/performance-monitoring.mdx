<Abstract>

I have been benchmarking continuously while building this website. Not too worried as [building with Astro is delivering on the promise](/meta/records/current/build-with-astro.mdx). But I noticed how my [previous site](/posts/2023-01/saying-goodbye-to-my-react-static-website)'s Lighthouse score was degrading for 3 years. Everything grows and evolves, so I will want to monitor my website's performance.

## Status :hourglass: some work to do

Can I run a lighthouse action, or something like that in CI?

What new tools are out there that I can leverage easily.

:writing_hand: Do write about this research.

:bulb: compare S3/CDN to netlify.
