## :writing_hand: I blogged about this

- [(re)Building my website with Astro + MDX + Preact](/posts/2023-01/building-my-website-with-astro-mdx-preact).
- [Saying goodbye to my React Static website.](/posts/2023-01/saying-goodbye-to-my-react-static-website).

</Note>

## Status

Replaced by [Rebuild with Astro](/meta/records/current/build-with-astro) because [React Static](/meta/records/rejected/react-static) is in maintenance mode now.

## Why

Alongside this Framework, I had also invested quite

- [Unified remark+rehype](/meta/records/rejected/content-markdown-unified-remark-rehype)

as well as bit in developer experience setup.

- [React Static + Typescript](/meta/records/rejected/react-static-typescript)
- [React Router](/meta/records/rejected/react-router)
- [Atomic semantics](/meta/records/rejected/conventions-structure-atomic-semantics)
- [SASS + Post CSS + CSS Variables](/meta/records/rejected/styling-sass-post-css)
