<Abstract>

I usually write about software, design, the ongoing evolution of how we work, and the processes that shape our relationship with the work we do. From hands-on building to the musings of a madman chasing challenges and cracking puzzles, all the way to research, exploration, strategy, and the metaphysics of it all.
