<Abstract>

Relaunching my website, again based on another Typescript SSG framework. Not React-Static anymore, not even React "at all". Introducing the magnificent Astro.

</Abstract>

<Note type="construction">

## :construction: Work in progress!

**Mind your head! Mind the gap!**

You are previewing the 2023 version of this site. It's nearly ready to go live, but meanwhile, please excuse me for the eventual glitches. There are still a few `404 Not Found!` and `Lorem ipsum` placeholders to address.

</Note>

## Backstory

Previous version of the website, back from 2019, was also [SSG](/tags/ssg) but built with [React Static](/meta/records/rejected/react-static), which is now sponsor-less and in maintenance mode.

Meanwhile, my website's core metrics have been degrading over the last 3 years and I could use the opportunity to dream up some exciting new features.

After some [reflection about the (great) react-static + unified.js experience](/posts/2023-01/saying-goodbye-to-my-react-static-website) I am moving on to something newer, faster, better.

## Why Astro?

Is this the static site generator I have _always_ been looking for?

I have been having a great experience while helping friends build the [Button School website](https://buttonschool.com/) and it really delivers on some of the promises.

### It is a great experience

- Easy to setup, uncomplicated.
- Sensible defaults but extensible.
- Amazing documentation.
- Fast builds.
- Very fast development server.

### It meets all my requirements

- :white_check_mark: (extensible) Markdown & MDX support.
- :white_check_mark: Fully SSG first.
- :white_check_mark: with opt-in, micro client [side islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/).
- :white_check_mark: with opt-in route pre-fetching support.
- :white_check_mark: 100/100 Lighthouse performance.
- :white_check_mark: SEO-friendly with canonical URLs / OpenGraph.
- :white_check_mark: Sitemap support.
- :white_check_mark: RSS Feed support.

Of course, there are always [some trade-offs](/meta/records/current/build-with-astro) to consider, but no deal breakers there.

### The project looks very healthy

I did chose the smaller community when I chose React Static. Kudos to [Tanner Linsley](https://tannerlinsley.com/), great work! But eventually React Static died out, and 4 years flew by :dizzy_face: meanwhile.

I wanted to make sure the next iteration of this website doesn't run into the same _oops_, so I have been watching Astro's community for signs.

And the signs are all good.

### Solid foundation

First of, Astro is built on a solid, well supported, but also quite modern stack:

It uses [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as a build orchestrator, famous for already [using ESM during development](https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html), which noticeably speeds ups HRM. Also under the hood, [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/). The Vite + Rollup pair is definitely mature, well tested, firmly set in our landscape for a while.

Astro's Markdown and MDX capabilities are also built around a super solid ecosystem. As I blogged :writing_hand: recently, in my opinion, [Unified.js is going to be around for a long time](/posts/2023-01/unified-js-is-going-to-be-around-for-a-long-time).

### Plugin architecture

Astro has a neat plugin architecture and plenty of tools to plug in already.

I am already using the following:

- [@astrojs/mdx](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/)
- [@astrojs/image](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/)
- [@astrojs/preact](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/)
- [@astrojs/rss](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/)
- [@astrojs/sitemap](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/)

Also, because [Unified.js](/tags/unified-js.mdx) has a pipeline architecture, you can plug in any [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/main/doc/plugins.md) and [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-autolink-headings) plugins as you want.

I am already using:

- [remark-emoji](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-emoji)
- [remark-a11y-emoji](https://github.com/florianeckerstorfer/remark-a11y-emoji)

### Community

Finally, the community looks very healthy, high energy, operating at high performance, and well governed.

Just take a look at:

- [Exploding showcase](https://astro.build/showcase) of awesome websites built with Astro.
- [Impressive development pace](https://github.com/withastro/astro/commits/main?before=8c100a6fe6cc652c3799d1622e12c2c969f30510+420&branch=main&path%5B%5D=packages&path%5B%5D=astro&path%5B%5D=CHANGELOG.md&qualified_name=refs%2Fheads%2Fmain) since v0 to the recent v2.
- [Growing number of integrations](https://astro.build/integrations/) and extensions.
- [Comprehensive documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/), accessible, easy to use.
- [Volume of issues closed](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues).
- [Structured, transparent approach via RFCs](https://github.com/withastro/rfcs).
- [High energy in discord sever](https://discord.com/invite/astro-community-700607091391594567).
- [Exciting community call videos](https://www.youtube.com/@astrodotbuild).

## Big kudos

Congrats to all the people involved this! SSG with Astro is kicking ass!

:heart_eyes: Great dev experience.

:fire: Fast.

:trophy: An [SSG](/tags/ssg) for the next decade.
