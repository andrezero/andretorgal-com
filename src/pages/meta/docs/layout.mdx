<Abstract>

This website uses break points defined by the content itself to reorganise content in 4 different layouts.

## Responsive layouts

What a struggle but :muscle: eventually satisfied. This was essentially a challenge from my friend [Nevan Scott](https://nevanscott.com/): to embrace [grid-template-areas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-areas) and shuffle things around depending on resolution.

Also, I wanted to NOT use centered layout, even for big screens. Let me know if I pulled it out.
