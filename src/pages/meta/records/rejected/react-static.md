## Status

[React Static](/meta/records/rejected/react-static) is in maintenance mode now.

Replacing it with [Astro](/meta/records/pending/rebuild-with-astro).

## Context

React Static

## Why

I blogged about it here [Staging My Website Rebuilt In React Static](/posts/2019-05/staging-my-website-v2-rebuilt-in-react-static)

Alongside this Framework, I had also invest in

- [React Static + Typescript](/meta/records/rejected/stack-react-static-typescript)
- [React Router ](/meta/records/rejected/stack-react-static-typescript)
- [Atomic semantics](/meta/records/rejected/conventions-atomic-semantics-css)
- [SASS + Post CSS + CSS Variables](/meta/records/rejected/styling-sass-post-css)
- [Unified remark+rehype](/meta/records/rejected/content-markdown-unified-remark-rehype)
