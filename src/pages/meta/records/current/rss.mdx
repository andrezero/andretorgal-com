<Abstract>

It's been ages since I've had a feed here.

Now I do [RSS](/rss.xml).

</Abstract>

## Why

[Astro RSS](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/rss/) is poor and incomplete (details below).

## Decision: handcraft :heart:

- small functions, strong types (less than 40 lines of code)
- [validated](https://validator.w3.org/feed/)
- full flexibility
- clean output

## Issues with Astro RSS

Poor docs.

No way to provide images and categories for items.

The generated rss doesn't even validate properly. Here's an example taken from their own [feed](https://astro.build/rss.xml).

```
<rss version="2.0">
<channel>
  <title>The Astro Blog</title>
  <description>News and updates about Astro.</description>
  <link>https://astro.build/</link>
  <item>
    <title>Astro 2.1</title>
    <link>https://astro.build/blog/astro-210/</link>
    <guid>https://astro.build/blog/astro-210/</guid>
    <description>[...]</description>

```

## Other options considered

Found only a few libraries.

Outdated, opinionated, not ergonomic:

- [feed](https://github.com/jpmonette/feed)
- [jsonfeed-to-rss](https://github.com/bcomnes/jsonfeed-to-rss)
