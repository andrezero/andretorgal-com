<Abstract>

About the typefaces used in this website and the responsive typographical scale in use.

</Abstract>

## Scaling

I am using a fluid proportional type scale.

More details in [Docs Styling](/meta/docs/styling).

## Typefaces

I am sticking to a sans/serif combination.

### Headings: Mulish

- Used for headings, "branded" copy, and navigation items.
- Used in `600` and `900` weights.

Get [Mulish on fonts.google.com](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mulish).

<div className="large">
  To take <a href="/meta">a trivial example</a>, which of us ever undertakes laborious _physical
  exercise_, except to obtain **some advantage** from it.
</div>

And I will give you a <a href="/meta">complete account of the system</a>, and expound the actual teachings of the great _explorer of the truth_, the master-builder of **human happiness**.

Because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally <a href="/meta">encounter consequences</a> that are extremely painful. Nor again is there _anyone who loves or pursues_ or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because_occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him **some great pleasure**.
