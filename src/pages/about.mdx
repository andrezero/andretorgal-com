<Abstract>

This is my home on the web. A place where I blog some thoughts and run a few
experiments.

Here, you can learn more about me, my work as software engineer and other stuff I
have been up to.

## :construction: Work in progress!

**Mind your head! Mind the gap!**

You are previewing the 2023 version of this site. It's nearly ready to go live, but meanwhile, please excuse me for the eventual glitches. There are still a few `404 Not Found!` and `Lorem ipsum` placeholders to address.

</Note>

## House rules

Just to be clear: this is my space - I own the content, the opinions are my own, and it does not represent the company I work for at the moment.

If you find something that resonates with you, or otherwise object to, feel free to drop me a line via twitter [@andrezero](https://twitter.com/andrezero) or email [info@andretorgal.com](mailto:info@andretorgal.com).

## On this website

You can find:

- some longer form [blog posts](/posts)
- neatly organised by [tags](/tags)
- some [meta](/meta) notes about this website and its development

## About Me

### Work

A seasoned web developer and agile practitioner with a diverse background in engineering and management. I have been coding, leading, mentoring and facilitating for 25 years. [Read more about my work](/about/work).

### Personal

A curious and passionate person. I like

- [music](/tags/music),
- [cycling](/tags/cycling),
- [places](/tags/place),
- [software-engineering](/tags/software-engineering),
- [... and things, ideas, and stuff](/tags/personal).

### Music

Every now and then I record something.

I invite you to [listen to some of my music](/about/music) now. Maybe even some [video with my music on it]()?

### One is a lie

- I once worked in an obscure, surreal, movie production, so my name is on [IMDB](https://imdb.com).
- I am afraid of heights, but I once bungee jumped from 68 meters high.
- Cristiano Ronaldo used to chill at my neighbor's house, but I never really talked to him.
- I got a tattoo of a French character done by an American dude in the Czech Republic.

## Under the hood

If you are curious about how this website ~~was built~~ is being built, take a look at [the docs](/meta).

_Spoiler_: it's a static site, entirely generated from Markdown files [here's the source code for the page you are currently reading](https://github.com/andrezero/andretorgal-site/blob/master/src/pages/about/index.md). I'm using [Astro](/posts/2023-01/building-my-website-with-astro-mdx-preact.md) as a generator, Typescript, and simple CSS.
