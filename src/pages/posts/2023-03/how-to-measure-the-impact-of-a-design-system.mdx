<Abstract>

There is not that much to read about [measuring design system value, impact, progress, ...](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+measure+the+value+of+a+design+system) but from the bits and pieces of what everyone is doing out there, it's possible to conceive a few ways to approach this problem.

## The million dollar question

To break the news really quick: there isn't a simple framework to measure the impact of a design system. If we take some of the [benefits of a design system](/posts/2023-02/benefits-of-design-systems) - e.g.: reduced cycle time, or user loyalty and retention - the first challenge is that you [we need to keep everything else constant (as possible)](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceteris_paribus) in order to measure the contribution of adopting the design system vs other initiatives or factors affecting the final outcome.

Having said that, improvements in lead time and cycle time can be observed with small scale experiments and having actionable lean/agile metrics in place can help a lot with this.

The second challenge is that some benefits can only be observed after a continued and disciplined investment over a period of time. The impact of consistency and quality on business performance via user satisfaction and loyalty requires achieving a certain level before yielding results.

Automated metrics extracted from code increments or snapshots can provide some good insights into how a system is being adopted, used, and evolving.
