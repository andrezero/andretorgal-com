<Abstract>

I honestly prefer english spelling. But support for `en-gb` in our tools is sometimes lacking and it can be frustrating.

</Abstract>

## Decision :flag-gb: of course

Please, `realising` over `realizing`. Please `neighbour` over `neighbor`.

Stick to :flag-gb: _English_, use a spelling extension.

- Use VS Code extension [Spell Right](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ban.spellright) because
  - fast: tested on huge documents with thousands of spelling errors
  - entirely offline :notbad:
  - good UX: `CMD+.` -> suggestions (multi-lingual) and add to dictionary
  - easy to track dictionaries and separate user and workspace dictionaries

## Curious note

:explode: everyone but Cambridge seems to think that trade-off should be spelled _trade-off_ and not _tradeoff_:

- [Cambridge: tradeoff](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/trade-off)
- [Oxford: trade-off](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/trade-off_2?q=tradeoff)
- [Merriam Webster: trade-off](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trade-off)
- [macmillan: trade-off](https://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/trade-off_2)
- [Collins: trade-off](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/trade-off)

The free dictionary believes both [tradeoff](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/tradeoff) and [trade-off](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/trade-off) are the same thing, and both equally :uk-flag: and :en-flag: ... :sweatsmile:
