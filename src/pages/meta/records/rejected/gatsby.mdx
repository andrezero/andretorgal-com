<Abstract>

I have been using my [own simple SSG](https://github.com/andrezero/guay) for 2 years now. But new tools have - obviously - emerged in the static sites space. Should I rebuild my site with Gatsby?

</Abstract>

## Status :x: Rejected

Turned down in favor of [React Static](/meta/records/rejected/react-static) + [markdown + unified.js](/meta/records/rejected/content-markdown-unified-remark-rehype)

## Why

- all data sources need a graphql layer
- data models in components, boilerplate
- not pure Typescript (many `js` config files)
- Typescript not compiled strict (not using `tsconfig.json`?) at develop/build time, probably my bad, but defaults and documentation were not helping
- brittle, multiple compilation issues so far

### Issues

- typed GraphQL queries
  - https://www.isaacbroyles.com/2018/08/19/gatsbyjs-typescript.html
- integration with Storybook, expected painful

## Was

- static site generator
- React + Typescript + SASS
- Plugin galore (images, attachments, meta, seo, ...)
