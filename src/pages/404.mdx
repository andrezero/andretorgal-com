<Abstract>

If you just landed on my website, sorry for the awkward introductions!

Hi :wave: I am Andr√© and this is [my website](/about/).

I invite you to take a look around and to reach out in case you relate strongly to anything.

Maybe there is a mistake in the link you just followed. Most likely, it's a typo.

It's also possible that this page existed before, and now it doesn't anymore.

But what if it only exists in the morning? :exploding_head: Or Tuesdays? :mushroom:

If you can crack this mystery, do let me know.
