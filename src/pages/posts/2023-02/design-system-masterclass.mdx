<Abstract>

Earlier this week I had the privilege of sharing a virtual stage with my good friend Nevan Scott to celebrate (and plug :muscle:) the new [Design System Short Course](https://buttonschool.com/design-systems/) that Button School recently launched.

</Abstract>

My friends Nevan and Victor are running the best design school in the neighborhood. Possibly the best one in town. Or even in ... Actually I don't know, I have't travelled that much, there might be better design educators somewhere else.

But I am not writing this post (just) to talk about them in (super)relative terms. Or to celebrate that Button School is deploying their courses with success :muscle:.

I actually wanted to celebrate the event itself. Celebrate the fact that 100 people signed up and more than 50% showed up :muscle:. Including designers, engineers, writers, all sorts of professionals and students from all around the world. And that most stayed with us a good bit beyond the scheduled hour, asking the most interesting and relevant questions, and sharing their experience as well.

The appetite is strong. Sign of the times.

> “[A design system is one of the most important strategic assets for your company](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/software-engineers-need-design-systems-to-build-products-with-good-ux). It is a living digital product that requires a team, a plan and a set of specialized tools,”

## A slow start

We probably took a bit to get up to speed. We didn't want to jump into the details without clarifying first some of the common myths.

> A Design System is not a component library.

So we dug into our memories of _when did you first hear the words "design system" for the first time?_ And, ultimately _what is a design system anyway?_

> It's how we design - how we make design decisions. If you are designing you have a system, even if you don't think about it in those terms. It might be a great system and it works for you, but if you reflect about how you are designing you will find opportunities to improve it.

Me, at some point, probably not helping to spread the enthusiasm for the craft.

> A design system is the community and the processes that binds it together.

Me as well, but :100: kudos Frank :wink: for helping to _wordsmith_ that one.

But, as per some of the feedback we received...

> It got very interesting after the intro and i think you gave really good tips.

It was also quite special to see some of my old students again - my "babies" are so grown up and mature - proud!

As application development becomes increasingly dynamic and complex, it's a challenge to deliver accessible and usable products with consistent style. This is particularly true in larger organizations with multiple teams working on different products. Design systems define a collection of design patterns, component libraries and good design and engineering practices that ensure consistent digital products. Built on the corporate style guides of the past, design systems offer shared libraries and documents that are easy to find and use. Generally, guidance is written down as code and kept under version control so that the guide is less ambiguous and easier to maintain than simple documents. Design systems have become a standard approach when working across teams and disciplines in product development because they allow teams to focus. They can address strategic challenges around the product itself without reinventing the wheel every time a new visual component is needed.
