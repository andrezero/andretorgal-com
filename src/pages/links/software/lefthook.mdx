<Abstract>

Fast and powerful Git hooks manager for Node.js and more.

## Thoughts

Stumbled open while working on [alternatives for husky](/meta/records/current/lefthook).

I like that

- it's fast! they claim it, and I could see that it is
- seems to be well maintained: 56 contributors, steady code frequency
- it has great docs
- :yum: run commands in parallel, simple configuration

I dislike

- :yuck: `yml` config

Makes [Husky](/links/software/husky) forgettable.

Also, the company behind the software seems to be cool.
