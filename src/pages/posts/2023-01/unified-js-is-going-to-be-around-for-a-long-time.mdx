<Abstract>

This library is powering your linter, prettier, this website, pretty much anything using MDX. It's becoming ubiquitous, it might one day be running in your fridge.

</Abstract>

## Context

I stumbled upon this project some 4 years ago. I believe because [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), then [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) were already using it.

## What is it?

From their beautiful site:

> We compile content to syntax trees and syntax trees to content.

An example of this is reading a [Markdown](/tags/markdown) file into a JS variable that you can modify and then output as HTML.

> We also provide hundreds of packages to work on the trees in between.

Yes, hundreds of little transformations, such as [add `target` and `rel` attributes to all external links](https://unifiedjs.com/explore/package/rehype-external-links/), or more complex ones, such as [generate a table of contents.](https://unifiedjs.com/explore/package/remark-toc/).

You can use them analyse the content, for instance for linting purposes. Strip content, re-arrange, re-format it.

> You can build on the unified collective to make all kinds of interesting things.

## An example

Since this website is [built with Astro](/posts/2023-01/building-my-website-with-astro-mdx-preact), and because Astro uses the Unified.js ecosystem for all things Markdown and MDX, I added `remark-emoji` to the [configuration](https://github.com/andrezero/andretorgal-site/blob/main/astro.config.mjs).

And the build now replaces `:muscle:` by ðŸ’ª!

Or even better, by adding `remark-a11y-emoji`, it replaces `:muscle:` by

```
<span role="img" aria-label="flexed biceps">ðŸ’ª</span>
```

## The kudos

The clever functional design, the rigor in principles, and patterns. You could tell that, even 4 years ago, that this was going to be around for a while.

Not only that, the super professional management of the project(s) and community, has been allowing it to grow this fast and conquer such an important space in the industry.

I also have the feeling that this project, that claims to be ...

> a collective

... has a certain human substance, strong ethical vibes, a certain :heart: _I am not really sure_, but you know what I mean.

> The unified collective is a federated system of organizations, consisting in turn of projects, governed by the team members steering them.

## Titus

The biggest kudos to [Titus](https://wooorm.com/) who I believe is _the_ origin of all this.

Their website now reads:

> I work most-time on open source maintaining 550+ projects that are downloaded 22B+ times a year.

Are you mind blown, yet?

At the moment, Prettier, ESLint, MDX, and probably millions of websites and services out there - arguably ALL modern documentation websites - contain some Unified.js code.

## How I use Unified.js

I used it quite a bit while building the [previous version of this website](/posts/2023-01/saying-goodbye-to-my-react-static-website.md). Since then, I reach out for it often at work, usually to patch up deficiencies in [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) or [Rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/) builds, as well as for source code generation use cases.
