<Abstract>

A design system is a strategic asset for any organisations. It is a living digital product that requires a team, a plan and a set of specialized tools. But what does this mean for my organisation? What do I need know and do to get it started, and how will I know if I am on the right track?

<Todo>Hero: it depends</Todo>

Replace "any organisation" with "your company" and the above abstract is a direct quote from [Gartnerâ€™s 2021 design system effectiveness report](https://www.knapsack.cloud/blog/gartner-design-system-effectiveness).

Gartner is adamant that a team and a plan are required. But Gartner consults for _the wall street_ and fortune 500 companies. What if my organisation is smaller, more modest?

## Do I even need a design system?

Yes.

## Do I need to build it?

Maybe.

Today it is unthinkable for most digital businesses to build and maintain their own datacenter. Likewise, it is very unlikely that all companies will continue to try to build and maintain their own system.

As systems become more and more complex and demanding, it will get harder to build your own system to a good enough level of quality, and with enough capabilities, to effective compete in increasingly more competitive markets.

In other words, in Wardley Mapping terms, design systems might become commodities pretty fast. Just how fast, might be hard to predict. But these platform-based or open-source design systems are going to evolve exponentially fast, and we shouldn't be surprised when Google, Microsoft, Adobe, all launch into the space of AI powered, experimentation ready, design systems as a service.

## Do I need a dedicated team?

Whether you are building your own, or on top of someone else's foundations of frameworks, most likely you still need a team.

Many systems out there have emerged from ad-hoc collaboration between departments or a small core of designers or engineers, working in the gaps between the higher priority stuff, until the efficiency gains are noticed by stakeholders who eventually decide to fund the initiative in hope of multiplying the positive impact.

Scaling up from grassroots, emergence, can prove difficult because it requires switching operating mode, in order to roll out changes to policies and practices across the entire organisation, frequently impacting practices in product, design, engineering, and other functions.

Bootstrapping a small design system core team early, and providing them the focus to gain momentum, allows setting up the core processes and tools in short time frames and provides a baseline to iterate and scale out, even if the next steps are towards decentralising the operations.

## What will this team do? And how big should it be?

At first glance the responsibilities around a design system are intertwined between different functional areas of an organisation: brand, marketing, product, platform, design, engineering.

There are several ways how an organisation can assign ownership and governance of specific functions of its design system. This [article on scaling design systems](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/team-models-for-scaling-a-design-system-2cf9d03be6a0) covers different models, from the most the simplistic solitary _overlord_ to very sophisticated _federated_ models.

I find it is helpful to consider the different nature of the activities.

## Where to start

In the ideal world you would be able to start with crystalised and meaningful design principles, out of which you could set in stone some really solid foundations for colour, typography, space. And only later you'd start working on patterns and components.

In reality, whether you've building your design system since your organisation's birth or you are building it from an existing design language, you will need to jumping between these levels of detail with iterations on detail informing the next
