<Abstract>

Some of the stuff on this site is _quite personal_.

</Abstract>

I have no problem publishing it online as I have been doing since my [early blogging days](/meta/project/archaeology).

If this weirds you out, try to remember if you have posted anything very personal on a supposedly :lock: private feed or a private group chat. Well you should know that it's not really private, right? :wink:

Well, I am here trying to establish a meaningful connection with other humans beings. It is a very asynchronous way of doing it. You might be reading this years after I wrote it. I will probably never hear back from you.

But still, you are.

Cheers.
