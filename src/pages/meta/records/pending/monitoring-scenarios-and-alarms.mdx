<Abstract>

I worked 2 years at New Relic, and I've been building frontends for more than two decades. So I know a thing or two about observability but should I bother? Regardless, I am still curious to know what's the landscape in 2023 for small website owners.

## Status :hourglass: some work to do

Find the minimum solution that could possibly work for knowing if there is trouble.

## Requirements

- simple to setup
- notifications: at least an email
- if using instrumentation
  - :exclamation: open-source client / kit
  - :exclamation: does not impact performance of site
  - :exclamation: does not capture any visitors data
- no superfluous data that no one (me) will ever analyse

Nice to have: free service.

## Scenarios to monitor

- the domain can not be reached
- not responding with the expected content (expected page is not there, empty, or fundamentally broken)
- detect spikes of 404 (possibly, some content was lost or misplaced during coding, build or deployment)
- detect client-side errors

## Options

- New Relic
- Datadog
- Sentry
- :construction:
- open source? self hosted? in the end it's a few functions and endpoints
