## Status

Obsolete, since [React Static](/meta/records/rejected/react-static) was replaced with [Astro](/meta/records/current/build-with-astro).

## Decision

Remove `reach-router` (bundled with React Static) and replace it with `react-router`.

## Why

- `reach-router` _divitis_ is unacceptable

## Trade-offs

- because now using `react-router` instead, need to implement accessible routing by hand
