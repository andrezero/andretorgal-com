<Abstract>

This library is now powering [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [prettier](https://prettier.io/), this website, ... and pretty much anything using MD(X). Which is a lot and is only going to grow in the future. I say: it's here to stay! :fist: And coming for your fridge.

## Context

I stumbled upon this project some 4 years ago. I believe because [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), then [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) were already using it.

## What is it?

From their beautiful site:

> We compile content to syntax trees and syntax trees to content.

An example of this is reading a [Markdown](/tags/markdown) file into a JS variable that you can modify and then output as HTML.

> We also provide hundreds of packages to work on the trees in between.

Yes, hundreds of little transformations, such as [add `target` and `rel` attributes to all external links](https://unifiedjs.com/explore/package/rehype-external-links/), or more complex ones, such as [generate a table of contents.](https://unifiedjs.com/explore/package/remark-toc/).

You can use them analyse the content, for instance for linting purposes. Strip content, re-arrange, re-format it.

> You can build on the unified collective to make all kinds of interesting things.

## How do you use it?

You create a _pipeline_, by composing a series of simple functions, and you can then you can use it to parse, transform, and render as many inputs as you want.

The `markdownToHtml()` function, accepts a markdown string and renders it to HTML.

```js
import html from 'rehype-stringify';
import markdown from 'remark-parse';
import remark2rehype from 'remark-rehype';
import unified from 'unified';

cosnt processor = unified()
  .use(markdown)
  .use(remark2rehype)
  .use(html);

async function markdownToHtml(input) {
  return process.processString(input).toString();
}
```

Notice that the `async` function. The pipelines are asynchronous and always return a promise.

## An example using community plugins

Since this website is [built with Astro](/posts/2023-01/building-my-website-with-astro-mdx-preact), and because Astro uses the Unified.js ecosystem for all things Markdown and MDX, I added `remark-emoji` to the [configuration](https://github.com/andrezero/andretorgal-site/blob/main/astro.config.mjs).

And the build now replaces `:muscle:` by ðŸ’ª!

Or even better, by adding `remark-a11y-emoji`, it replaces `:muscle:` by

```
<span role="img" aria-label="flexed biceps">ðŸ’ª</span>
```

To plug these two transformations to the above example, all you have to do is:

```js
import a11yEmoji from '@fec/remark-a11y-emoji';
import emoji from 'remark-emoji';

cosnt processor = remark() // <-- you can also start with remark
  .use(remarkEmoji) // <-- transform :beer: to emoji
  .use(remarkA11yEmoji) // <--  transform to `<span...>`
  .use(remark2rehype)
  .use(html);
```

## The kudos :100:

The clever functional design, the rigor in principles, and patterns. :star-struck:

You could tell, even 4 years ago, that this was going to be around for a while.

Not only that, the super professional management of the project(s) and community, has been allowing it to grow this fast and conquer such an important space in the industry.

I also have the feeling that this project, that claims to be ...

> a collective

... has a certain human substance, strong ethical vibes, a certain :heart: _I am not really sure_, but you know what I mean.

> The unified collective is a federated system of organizations, consisting in turn of projects, governed by the team members steering them.

## Titus

The biggest kudos to [Titus](https://wooorm.com/) who I believe is _the_ origin of all this.

Their website now reads:

> I work most-time on open source maintaining 550+ projects that are downloaded 22B+ times a year.

Are you mind blown :exploding_head:, yet?

At the moment, Prettier, ESLint, MDX, and probably millions of websites and services out there - arguably ALL modern documentation websites - contain some Unified.js code.

## How I use Unified.js

Before discovering [Unified.js](https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified) I used many libraries to parse (and generate) Markdown documents. I remember `marked` but in an [even older version of this website](/meta/project/archaeology) I found [markdown-js](https://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js) (now 13 years old :joy: and unmaintained).

Since discovering the Unified.js ecosystem of highly pluggable micro libraries, I never used anything else. I reach for it all the time now, especially at work, usually to patch up deficiencies in tools such as [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) or [Rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/).

Fix builds, automate boring tasks, lint code, prevent errors, ...

Quite a :hammer: tool to carry in your tool belt.

## Show me some code!

Sure! I used it extensively to build this website. So you'll find some examples of manipulation in [this part of the repository](https://github.com/andrezero/andretorgal-site/tree/main/src/integration).

I created the `remark/` plugins to manipulate the `markdown` tree:

- `autoAbstract()` extracts `abstract` from the document and stores in a metadata object.
- `autoImages()` replace image relative paths with absolute ones and.
- `customComponents()` makes sure that instead of rendering `<img>` tags we render a custom component.
- and `autoImports()` injects `import` statements in the MDX context so that I don't have to manually import commonly used components.

The `rehype/` plugins manipulate the `HTML`, also in [abstract tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) format, just before it is rendered. I only needed one - `externalLinks()` - to add `rel="noopener"` to all the <a href="https://somwhereelse.com">external links</a>.
