<Abstract source="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58860197-this-woman-s-work/">

The strange tale of a boy named [Flea](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flea_(musician)>) starts in Rye, NY. It was all very normal. But soon his parents divorced and his mother Patricia remarried a jazz musician. [...] He was on the streets by 14 and soon after, met another social outcast and drug user named [Anthony Kiedis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Kiedis). They formed a band that would become the [Red Hot Chili Peppers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers).

</Abstract>

I wanted to buy it since I watched [Flea's interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chIujHJHo78). As soon as I got it, took me a couple of weeks to finish. Had to stop to watch the [Suburbia (1983)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086589/) movie, which led to watching [The decline of Western Civilization](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082252/?) and everything else by [Penelope Spheeris](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0790715/).

It's all related, believe me.

> It seemed like a good idea at the time.

I know the feeling.
