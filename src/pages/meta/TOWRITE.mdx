## Post: DEFCON 31 - The future will prevail

- https://defcon.org/html/defcon-31/dc-31-theme.html

### Information overload

### Pace of change

> We can retreat into an idealized past of simpler times where we were less aware, we can become frozen in our present or we can adapt and ride the shockwave into the future.

> As you work on your various projects, keep in mind that the future is undefeated, and it belongs to the resourceful, the brave and most of all to those who can see around the corner of what is and what might be.

I guess this applies to us all.
