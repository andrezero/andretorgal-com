## Work in progress!

**Mind your head! Mind the gap!**

You are previewing the 2023 version of this site. It's nearly ready to go live, but meanwhile, please excuse me for the eventual glitches. There are still a few `404 Not Found!` and `Lorem ipsum` placeholders to address.

## What's on this website?

A little bit [about me](/about), [my work](/about/work), and [my music](/about/music).

A [blog](/posts), where I post about my favorite topics: [music](/tags/music), [cycling](/tags/cycling), [places](/tags/place), [software-engineering](/tags/software-engineering) and [more stuff I dig](/tags/personal).

And some pretty dense materials about [how this site is built](/meta).
