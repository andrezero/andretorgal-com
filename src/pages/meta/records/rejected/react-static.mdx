<Abstract>

I have been using my [own simple SSG](https://github.com/andrezero/guay) for 2 years now. But new tools have - obviously - emerged in the static sites space. Should I rebuild my site with React Static?

## :writing_hand: I blogged about this

- [(re)Building my website with Astro + MDX + Preact](/posts/2023-01/building-my-website-with-astro-mdx-preact).
- [Saying goodbye to my React Static website.](/posts/2023-01/saying-goodbye-to-my-react-static-website).
- [Staging My Website Rebuilt In React Static](/posts/2019-05/staging-my-website-v2-rebuilt-in-react-static).

</Note>

## Status :x: Replaced

Replaced by [Rebuild with Astro](/meta/records/current/build-with-astro) because [React Static](/meta/records/rejected/react-static) is in maintenance mode now.

Alongside this Framework, I had also invested quite a bit in

- [Unified remark+rehype](/meta/records/rejected/content-markdown-unified-remark-rehype)
- [React Router](/meta/records/rejected/react-router)
- [Atomic semantics](/meta/records/rejected/conventions-structure-atomic-semantics)
- [SASS + Post CSS + CSS Variables](/meta/records/rejected/styling-sass-post-css)

:point_up: all of the above now replaced with the migration to Astro.

## Why

At the time, I selected React Static [over Gatsby](./gatsby) because:

- non-opinionated, pure React
- easy to use any data source
- implicit and explicit code & data splitting
- typescript entry point
- typescript compiler using tslint.json
