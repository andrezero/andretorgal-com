<Abstract source="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58860197-this-woman-s-work/">

Edited by [Kim Gordon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Gordon) and [Sinéad Gleeson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin%C3%A9ad_Gleeson), features a collection of 17 essays about women who _kicked in doors_ - pioneers, activists, feminists.

</Abstract>

My wife gave it to me on my birthday, in 2022, I believe. I read a couple of essays, and then lost it on a plane. I bought another copy – not the hard cover version, though :cry: – and devoured it in a few days.

Not all essays are brilliant or even easy to read. But all are meaningful and they all taught me something about important.
