## :writing_hand: I blogged about this

- [Saying goodbye to my React Static website](posts/2023-01/saying-goodbye-to-my-react-static-website.md).

</Note>

## Context

Since 2019 I have had this this website hosted on S3/Cloudfront at around $2.50/month.

But Netlify provides an awesome developer experience with integrated zero config deploy. And - honestly - it would feel good to have my personal website extricated from the great giant. I am using 0.001% of AWS capabilities.

## Status

Pending ...

- Netlify costs? is still the unknown
- My motivation to deal with domain migrations? zero!

## Details

### Option Netlify

- :heart_eyes: great experience
- :fearful: unknown cost
- :tired_face: overhead: domain configuration

### Fallback: AWS S3

- :thumbsup: known cost: 2 bucks / month
- :cry: terrible experience
