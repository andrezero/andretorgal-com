import Year from '@components/mdx/Year.astro';

Previously this same website was built with

<Year y="2019-2022" />

-   [React Static](/meta/records/rejected/react-static)
-   [SCSS](/meta/records/rejected/styling-sass-post-css)
-   hosted on AWS S3

<Year y="2009-2019" />

It's embarrassing, but my online identity, presence, and content were entirely suppressed, swallowed bones and all, by the social networks for [reasons I explored in this post](/posts/2017-01/hello-world).

<Year y="2003-2009" />

-   Wordpress
-   self-hosted on paid hosting services

<Year y="2000-2002" />

-   PHP
-   self-hosted on paid hosting services

<Year y="1998-2000" />

-   Static HTML+CSS+JS
-   self-hosted on paid hosting services
