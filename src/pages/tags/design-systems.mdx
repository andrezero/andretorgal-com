<Abstract>

A design system is one of the most important strategic assets for your company. It is a living digital product that requires a team, a plan and a set of specialized tools.

**Gartner, March 2021**

</Abstract>

The above snippet is from Garnet's report [Build Better Products Faster With Design Systems](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3998770). I believe this report was publicly available until recently. Or least a big part of it was. But not anymore, sorry... paywall! And a _Fortune 500_ kind of paywall, not your regular $9.90/mo.
