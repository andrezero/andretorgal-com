## Tone of voice

Hi there! :wave:

Out of respect for the humans that sporadically visit this site, as well as out of a desire to grow, I concluded that having some sort of guidelines - and guardrails - will help me streamline the process, accelerate my learning, improve my writing faster.

:warning: A work in progress: still figuring out what I sound like it.

### Values first

I want to stay honest and true to [my mission](/about/work#mission) and [my values](/about/work#values).

If I am writing - and pretending that someone else is reading - then I am growing and learning in collaboration, inspiring others to do the same.

Call me an idealist. :joy:

#### Positive

I love talking about possibility, dreams, ideals.

I might occasionally rant about something - automobiles for instance - but the focus is always on aspiring to create something better, greater, totally awesome - such as bicycles and cycle lanes.

#### Seriously laid back

I try to treat every subject with the utmost respect because every thing is eventually loved by someone out there in ways that I can't even begin to understand.

I am writing to learn, to practice, to eventually connect with other humans. I might be passionate about a few things but I don't pretend to be an authority on any of those things. In the end, writing here is just a hobby.

#### Real voice

When I am writing, I am reading it back.

I frequently search for synonyms and take inspiration from articles and books. But I always try to imagine my voice saying the words. Now and then, when there's no one around the house, :sweat_smile" I even vocalise it.

If it sounds like _not me, not Andre Torgal_, then I don't use it.

In other words, I am not writing anything here that I wouldn't say during a chilled eventing around the coffee table.

### Purposeful structure

Guidelines:

- Have some to say, say it.
- Identify the main point early.
- Use structure to breakdown the thing(s) / topic(s).
- Use narrative to get you started.
- Use rhythm to take you the distance.
- Use bullet points to summarise.
- Use links to make the journey more direct.

This last point is a powerful driver of [information architecture](./information-architecture) requirements and authoring experience. I want to use new page + new link as much as possible in my workflow and I want that authoring experience to be seamless.

### Accessible

Use accessibility mechanisms to talk directly to different audiences.

### Assorted, diversified, multifaceted

This website, especially the blog section, is a weird mix of personal and work related stuff.

The work related posts range from boring details about something specific, to thinking about complex systems and having _everything is connected_ kind of epiphanies.

While the personal ones go from candid introspection on serious matters to rambling about what doesn't matter.

I find it helps to allow the vibe to vary a lot from post to post. But it's important to apply it consistently throughout the article.

I need to take special care when editing old drafts or revising articles and pages published a long time ago.

## Emoji

Yes! I embraced it. :kissing_closed_eyes: emojis.

- Emoji go after punctuation, :point_left: after comas, periods, and question marks? :upside_down_face:
- Avoid using more than 2 emojis per paragraph.
- In the darkest, most serious page, make sure there is at least one face. :grimacing:
- Occasionally throw a party and invite everyone in: :drum_with_drumsticks: :fire: :boom: :dragon: :japanese_goblin:

## :flag-gb: Spelling

I am sticking to _English_ of course.

I am using a spelling extension in VS Code: [Spell Right](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ban.spellright) because:

- It's fast: tested on huge documents with thousands of spelling errors
- Works entirely offline.
- UX: quick to apply suggestions and add to dictionary using keyboard only.
- Easy to track separate user and workspace dictionaries.

### Curious note

:exploding_head: everyone but Cambridge seems to think that trade-off should be spelled trade-off and not tradeoff:

- [Cambridge: tradeoff](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/trade-off)
- [Oxford: trade-off](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/trade-off_2?q=tradeoff)
- [Merriam Webster: trade-off](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trade-off)
- [macmillan: trade-off](https://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/trade-off_2)
- [Collins: trade-off](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/trade-off)

The free dictionary believes both [tradeoff](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/tradeoff) and [trade-off](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/trade-off) are the same thing, and both equally :uk-flag: and :en-flag: ... :sweatsmile:
