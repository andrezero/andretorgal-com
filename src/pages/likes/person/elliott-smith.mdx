A desperate drunk man once [asked](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Big_Trouble_in_Little_Sanchez/Transcript)?

> How can someone so talented die so young?

>
> [Misery Loves Elliott Smith](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/misery-loves-elliott-smith-96064/)
>
> RollingStone, September 1998.

> ♪ drink up, baby ♪ ♪ stay up all night ♪
