<Abstract>

If you just landed on my website, sorry for the awkward introductions!

Hi :wave: I am Andr√© and this is [my website](/about/).

I invite you to take a look around, and reach out in case you relate strongly to something.

## 404 Not Found

Maybe there is a mistake in the link you just followed. Or maybe it was intentional, just to throw you off and :grimacing: make you read this?

But most likely it's a typo.

If you think it's a typo do let me know. :pleading_face:

### It's also possible that this page existed before, and now it doesn't anymore.

But what if it only exists in the morning? :exploding_head: Or Tuesdays? ... or February? :mushroom: Whatever is not currently happening where you are?

If you can crack this mystery, also let me know.
