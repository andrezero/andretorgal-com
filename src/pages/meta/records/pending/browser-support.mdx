<Abstract>

Which browsers should this website be worried about? I'll always favor progressive approaches, or even all in _the future is now_. But I am also concerned with who is left out.

</Abstract>

## Status :hourglass: some work to do

I'd love to research about devices, geography, inclusion. But I love procrastinating even more.

Also, PostCSS is not reading `browserslist` and :grimacing: couldn't find any [documentation for using "browserslist" in Astro](https://github.com/withastro/docs/issues/2321)

Attempted the solution described in the attached issue. :rabbit: :hole: Nothing prefixed, and warnings polluting the console :worried:

`[esbuild-plugin-browserslist] Skipping unknown target: entry=and_qq 13.1, browser=and_qq, version=13.1`

## Details

This was previously adopted in 2019 for the [previous version of this website](/meta/records/rejected/react-static).

- using [browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) + [post-css-preset-env](https://github.com/csstools/postcss-preset-env)
- write only good, standards code
- don't bother with polyfills and fallbacks

**Previously:**

```json
// package.json > browserslist
["cover 95%", "not dead"]
```

**Now**

```json
// package.json > browserslist
["last 2 years", "> 1%", "not ie 11", "not ie_mob 11", "not op_mini all"]
```

## Why

- just auto-prefixing
- not explicitly supporting any browser that

  - pollutes CSS with fallbacks
  - requires contorts the CSS
  - harms the developer experience

## Tradeoffs

- coverage down to 89%
- very minimal CSS available for IE 11 and Opera Mini

  - CSS is using custom properties very liberally
  - current technique requires that fallback is always provided to the rule
  - not up for that
