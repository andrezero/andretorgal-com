<Abstract>

This is my home on the web. A place where I blog some thoughts and run a few
experiments.

Here, you can learn more about me, my work as software engineer and other stuff I
have been up to.

## House rules

Just to be clear: this is my space - I own the content, the opinions are my own, and it does not represent the company I work for at the moment.

If you find something that resonates with you, or otherwise object to, feel free to drop me a line at [hello@andretorgal.com](mailto:hello@andretorgal.com).

## On this website

You can find:

- some longer form [blog posts](/posts)
- neatly organised by [tags](/tags)
- some [meta](/meta) notes about this website and its development

### Music

Every now and then I record something.

I invite you to [listen to some of my music](/about/music) now. Maybe even some [video with my music on it](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4YAgk0hQbLe78EV0njtKIA)?

### One is a lie

- I once worked in an obscure, surreal, movie production, so my name is on [IMDB](https://imdb.com).
- I am afraid of heights, but I once bungee jumped from 68 meters high.
- Cristiano Ronaldo used to chill at my neighbor's house, but I never really talked to him.
- I got a tattoo of a French character done by an American dude in the Czech Republic.

## Under the hood

This site is entirely static and entirely generated from MDX files. For example, [here's the source code for the page you are currently reading](https://github.com/andrezero/andretorgal-site/blob/master/src/pages/about.mdx).

I'm using [Astro](/posts/2023-01/building-my-website-with-astro-mdx-preact.md) as a generator and a lot of customisations pieced together from [astro-m2dx](https://astro-m2dx.netlify.app/) and the [unified.js](https://unifiedjs.com/) ecosystem.

There's a lot more information in the [meta section](/meta) of this website.
