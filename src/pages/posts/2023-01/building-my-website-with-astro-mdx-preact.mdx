## Work in progress!

**Mind your head! Mind the gap!**

You are previewing the 2023 version of this site. It's nearly ready to go live, but meanwhile, please excuse me for the eventual glitches. There are still a few `404 Not Found!` and `Lorem ipsum` placeholders to address.

</Note>

## Backstory

Previous version of the website, back from 2019, was also SSG but built with [React Static](/meta/records/rejected/react-static), which is meanwhile sponsor-less and in maintenance mode.

Meanwhile, my website's core metrics have been degrading over the last 3 years and I could use the opportunity to dream up some exciting new features.

After some [reflection about the (great) react-static + unified.js experience](/posts/2023-01/saying-goodbye-to-my-react-static-website) I am moving on to something newer, faster, better.

## Why Astro?

Is this is the static site generator I have _always_ been looking for?

I have been having a great experience while helping friends build the [Button School website](https://buttonschool.com/) and it really delivers on some of the promises.

### It is a great experience

- Easy to setup, uncomplicated.
- Sensible defaults but extensible.
- Amazing documentation
- Fast builds
- Very fast development server

### It meets all my requirements

- :check: (extensible) Markdown & MDX support
- :check: Fully SSG first
- :check: with opt-in, micro client side _islands_
- :check: with opt-in route pre-fetching support
- :check: 100/100 Lighthouse performance
- :check: SEO-friendly with canonical URLs / OpenGraph
- :check: Sitemap support
- :check: RSS Feed support

Of course, there are always [some trade-offs](/meta/records/current/build-with-astro) to consider, but no deal breakers there.

### The project looks very healthy

I did chose the smaller community when I chose React Static. Kudos to [Tanner Linsley](https://tannerlinsley.com/), great work! But eventually React Static died out, and meanwhile its been 4 years :shocked:.

I wanted to make sure the next iteration of this website doesn't run into the same oops, so I have been watching Astro's community for signs.

And the signs are all good.

First of, Astro is built on a solid, well supported, but also quite modern stack:

It uses [vite]() as a compiler, famous for its approach

It's built around MDX available via Unified.js ecosystem. And [Unified.js is going to be around for a long time](/posts/2023-01/unified-js-is-going-to-be-around-for-a-long-time).

Finally, the community looks very healthy, high energy, operating at high performance and with good governance.

Just take a look at

- [exploding showcase](https://astro.build/showcase) of awesome websites built with Astro, the best sign there could be
- [impressive development pace](https://github.com/withastro/astro/commits/main?before=8c100a6fe6cc652c3799d1622e12c2c969f30510+420&branch=main&path%5B%5D=packages&path%5B%5D=astro&path%5B%5D=CHANGELOG.md&qualified_name=refs%2Fheads%2Fmain) since v0 to the recent v2
- [growing number of integrations](https://astro.build/integrations/) and extensions
- [comprehensive documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/), accessible, easy to use
- [volume of issues closed](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues)
- [structured, transparent approach via RFCs](https://github.com/withastro/rfcs)
- [high energy in discord sever](https://discord.com/invite/astro-community-700607091391594567)
- [exciting community call videos](https://www.youtube.com/@astrodotbuild)

Great dev experience. Fast. An SSG for the next decade.

## Big kudos

Congrats to all the people involved this! Also great to see the community building up.

SSG is kicking ass.

## Under the hood

Astro uses [vite]() as a compiler.

Astro has a neat plugin architecture and plenty of tools to plug in already. I am using the following:

- [@astrojs/mdx](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/)
- [@astrojs/image](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/)
- [@astrojs/preact](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/)
- [@astrojs/rss](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/)
- [@astrojs/sitemap](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/)

## Why MDX?

> MDX is a special flavor of Markdown that supports embedded JavaScript & JSX syntax. This unlocks the ability to [mix JavaScript and UI Components into your Markdown content](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#mdx-features) for things like interactive charts or alerts.

Back in 2019 I took a good look at MDX but
