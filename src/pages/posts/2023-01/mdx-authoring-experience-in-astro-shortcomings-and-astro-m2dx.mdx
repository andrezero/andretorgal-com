<Abstract>

Since I am migrating this site to Astro - which I am convinced is the best SSG out there right now - I was expecting to have the same [advanced MDX authoring experience](/posts/2023-01/saying-goodbye-to-my-react-static-website) as in my previous website. Better even, maybe the challenges I was not able to solve before were meanwhile solved by the awesome folks out there.

But I know well, there will be :dragon: :dragon: :dragon: dragons!

As I wrote before, I have a [long list of requirements for the experience](/posts/2023-01/mdx-authoring-experience-in-astro-shortcomings-and-astro-m2dx) I want to have when authoring and managing content on my website.

Most of these features were working quite well in the [previous version of this website](/posts/2023-01/saying-goodbye-to-my-react-static-website). And they weren't that hard to accomplish! I rolled my own [remark, rehype pipeline](/posts/2023-01/unified-js-is-going-to-be-around-for-a-long-time), so I was free to make any choices I pleased about where the files should live, [frontmatter](https://mdxjs.com/guides/frontmatter/) manipulations, image optimisations, the works.

## Computer says no

Unfortunately, Astro built-in features are not that flexible. :sweat: On the contrary, they are [by design very opinionated](https://github.com/withastro/roadmap/pull/373) about some things.

Relevant to my interests is the strong preference of [@astrojs/image](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/image/) to have all media stored in the `public/` folder. And the pages? Well those, go in `src/pages` :cry:.

Like 5 of my requirements became a bit more difficult in one go... Oh my! this is going to be a wild ride through a few rabbit :rabbit: :hole: holes.

Can't believe I actually contemplated using ugly `../../public/...` paths for a bit. Then I tried writing a simple remark plugin. Nah, things started breaking :scream: ... Whatever I tried, I was either breaking the `dev` server or the static build.

What about [Astro collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/)? It would allow me to cleanup the frontmatter and not repeat `layout: ...` everywhere. But could I have two items of different collections in the same folder? Oh noooooo! :astonished: Astro's MD/X features are again "file system first":

> A content collection is any directory inside the reserved `src/content` ...

After tinkering with all possible configuration options, searching in [hundreds of Astro built websites](https://github.com/search?q=%22%40astrojs%2Fmdx%22&type=code), and reading through some disappointing [conversations in Github issues](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/5008) ... :tired_face: ... I decided to use less built-in features and search for community plugins instead.

## Third-party package: `astro-m2dx`

Honestly, Astro's community is big and growing, but the only thing out there that stood out was the [astro-m2dx project](https://astro-m2dx.netlify.app/) which immediately resonated, a lot, with what I was looking for:

> • Define default frontmatter properties for all files in a directory, e.g. the layout
>
> • Map HTML elements to JSX components on a per-directory basis
>
> • Auto-import known JSX components on a per-directory basis
>
> • Scan the document for Title or Abstract

Unfortunately, the image implementation depends on using `import` - as suggested by the [Astros's documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/image/#images-in-public).

But if the reference to the image is no longer a string with a resolvable `path/to/image.jpg` then I can't reuse it easily - or can't use it at all - in other places such as the `og:image` tag, or in good old thumbnails in lists.

I still considered dealing with that later, and focus on the other `astro-m2dx` features. But the first time I deployed it, the _auto imports_ feature was simply not working.

In conclusion, `astro-m2dx` has some really cool features, some very smart tricks inside, and depends on some super useful utils published independently as the [m2dx-utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/m2dx-utils) package.

But the author is focused on other (much more important) things right now, and won't be able to help me with the [really strange and opaque :x: CI issue](https://github.com/christian-hackyourshack/npm/issues/65) that I ran into.

## Conclusion

Time to take this into my own hands :fist: and have a go at putting together an "integration", using bits and pieces from all the things I saw in the last 2 weeks, and deliver that [superior MDX authoring experience with Astro](/posts/2023-01/improving-mdx-experience-in-astro-with-relative-paths-responsive-images-and-more).
