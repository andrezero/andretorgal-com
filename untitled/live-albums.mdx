## 1986 Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band - Live/1975-85

![Live/1975-85 - Album Cover](./albums/bruce-springsteen-and-the-e-street-band-live-1975-1985.png "// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bruce_Springsteen_Live_75-85.jpg")

I had been obsessing with the Boss for a couple of years, since I got a copy of _Born in the USA_, when a friend found this five vinyl record release in their parents collection and recorded the whole thing into 3 cassettes for my 13th birthday.

Just learned this is 2nd best-selling album of all time in the US and I am not surprised at all. These are the 10 years that _made_ the Boss, backed by the founding members of the _E-street Band_, including Max Weinberg, Clarence Clemons, and Garry Tallen. And it goes on to include stints of Steve Van Zandt, Patti Scialfa, and Nils Lofgren.

## [1984] Dire Straits - Alchemy: Dire Straits Live 

I watched this on video first, at my cousin's, when I was super young. They were big fans, so probably they this when it came out. My cousin would play back to me and point all the details, this guitar, the other guitar, and how Mark Knopfler would throw his. 

A year later, some neighbour showed it to me again and I was hooked. Although it's another guitar centric live album, with plenty of long, long solos, it is not a jammy gig at all, even if there is some improvisation in the guitar solos. 

It's all carefully

## [1973] Led Zeppelin - The Song Remains the Same 

As good as some of the Led Zeppelin studio albums may be, no matter how unreproducible live might be their later studio recordings, this is the sound that comes to might when I think of most of their songs. [Listen on Spotify to The Song Remains the Same](https://open.spotify.com/album/0ui4S0TZghkf1d1Wz0oWpk?si=ok5xCisiTmy3-k4Q0hymNg). 

If you never watched this, do find the time. Bare in mind the sound on this youtube video is a bit fake, but it's the same recording from Madison Square Garden. 

The footage of the minimum stage in such a big venue is puzzling. But it makes an ever better scenario for a Page vs Plant self-indulgent battle of the egos, violin bow, the works, keeping the creative juices flowing for over 30 mins on a single song.

Maybe you also want to check some [footage from John Bonnan's solo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOSf9f5_qZ8) after you realise that the Moby Dick track is almost 10 mins of Bonzo time. 

When I was in high-school, listening to it was accessible, because cassettes. But I knew people that described what they had seen on some neighbour's VHS and I would happily sit there forever, listening to someone describe Bonnan's kit and drumming. 

And we'd convinced ourselves though vigorous air drums that we had memorise the whole piece. I can't remember how I got hold of a tape with this concert. I actually think it was incomplete. But I remember I played it endlessly. Trying to imitate solos on my acoustic guitar again and again. Not even playing much attention, just tripping, acting out on my bed room, pretending to be Jimmy Page. 

For some reason, this tape never survived and I actually forgot I ever had it. It was only recently that I came across the epic footage on youtube and then tracked it down again on Spotify.

## [1991] Faith No More - Live at the Brixton Academy 


It pains that I lived in Lambeth for 6 years and never watched a show in here. Commuted via Brixton hundreds of times, cycled there right in front of the Academy, and checked out the bill for the night, but no one really interesting was ever playing. I remember having some food around in the evening and watching the cues. Taking the metro and being harassed by scalpers selling fake tickets to whatever. 

I remember coming back home drunk from the office pub, as one does in London, and watching people coming out the Academy after a show.

## [1988] Chet Baker - Live in Hannover 

I remember I discovered this one in 1994 and it blew me away, heart and soul, the very first moment. A parent of one of my friends had an extensive, and expensive, Jazz collection including a load of [ECM](https://www.ecmrecords.com/home) rarities. This is Chet Baker's last concert, It features Radio Orchestra Hannover and NDR Big Band. It is superbly recorded. 

In some moments you have him whispering a faint cry in your hair and you can hear the spit in his lips, in the trumpet's mouthpiece. Next moment it's string ensemble or big band. Then back to a delicate
guitar solo and soft brush. 

I got it on tape and fell asleep many times listening to this. Must have lost the tape before 1998 because when I wanted to share this with my wife, I couldn't find it anymore.

## [1969] Jefferson Airplane - Bless Its Pointed Little Head 

![Bless Its Pointed Little Head - Album Cover|lu https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BlessItsPointedLittleHead.jpg](./albums/jefferson-airplane-bless-Its-pointed-ittle-head.png)

Going through a few articles out there, including this [Rolling Stone Greatest Live
Albums](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/50-greatest-live-albums-of-all-time-173246/the-replacements-the-shit-hits-the-fans-1985-154247/), checking if was forgetting something dear to my heart, I verified that are a few albums I should really check out and I started with this Jefferson Airplane one, going in very skeptical about the quality of the recording. 

Trippy as I was guessing. Long solos, mantra like moments, but also great dynamics, great bursts of energy. Recorded between two venues - San Francisco and New York - with an extraordinary quality and mixed with a very wide stereo field: rhythm guitar full left, then the bass, drums, voices, lead guitar on the right end. Also, a lot of depth and ambience, with the audience in between cuts providing a rough idea of what these venues were like. 

[Listen on Spotify to Bless Its Pointed Little Head](https://open.spotify.com/album/2ZkdTV6IV5arY4hS6ztM2g?si=xw5cuVQOR9GKvJX0xAMuwg). 

Great jamming potential, going to come back often at decent times so I can play along.
