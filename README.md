## What's on the site?

A little bit [about me](https://andretorgal.com/about/), [my work](https://andretorgal.com/about/work/), and my [music](https://andretorgal.com/about/music/).

A blog, where I post about my favorite [topics](https://andretorgal.com/tags/).

## How does is it work?

This is site is built with [Astro](https://asrtro.build), and heavily customised using tools from [astro-m2dx](https://astro-m2dx.netlify.app/) and [unified](https://unifiedjs.com/).

Where's what?

```
src/
  + components/
  + integration/   - extending Astro
  + sources/       - querying for posts
  + templates/     - "layouts"
  + pages/         - all the content (and routing)
```

There's a lot more information in the [meta section](https://andretorgal.com/meta/) and in some posts I wrote while I migrated to Astro:

- [Advanced MDX authoring experience: Requirements](https://andretorgal.com/posts/2023-01/advanced-mdx-authoring-experience-requirements/)
- [MDX authoring experience in Astro: Shortcomings](https://andretorgal.com/posts/2023-01/mdx-authoring-experience-in-astro-shortcomings-and-astro-m2dx/)
- [Improving (MDX) authoring experience in Astro: Solutions](https://andretorgal.com/posts/2023-01/improving-mdx-experience-in-astro-with-relative-paths-responsive-images-and-more/)
