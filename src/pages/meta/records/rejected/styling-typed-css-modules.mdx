<Abstract>

We are using [Sass + PostCSS](/meta/records/rejected/styling-sass-post-css) all the way, but can we have modules, and can we have them strongly typed for Typescript code?

</Abstract>

## Status: :x: Replaced

Replaced with simple [css](/meta/records/current/styling-css) since [React Static](/meta/records/rejected/react-static) was replaced with [Astro](/meta/records/current/build-with-astro) which provides a great CSS modules like experience out of the box.

## Why

- polluting filesystem with extraneous `*.scss.d.ts` (gitignored for)
- had to patch up webpack config in `node.api.js`
  - solves ssg time vs client time hydration of css module classes (see backlog.md issues)
  - underlying `css-loader` is setup to always "extract css to file during node build process"
- build can become flaky
  - right now typescript complains during webpack build `TS2307: Cannot find module './Post.scss'.`
  - but both the ssg and client app seem to be working just fine (for now)
- also, `typings-for-css-modules-loader` not compatible with `css-loader@2` and requires the following in `package.json`

## Trade-offs

- was scoping out of global css for atoms, components, ...
- was helping prevent errors in compile time
- faster feedback, better developer experience

## Was

- `.react-static/node-api.js` webpack config

  - is using [typings-for-css-modules-loader](https://github.com/Jimdo/typings-for-css-modules-loader)
  - as per this [guide](https://medium.com/@sapegin/css-modules-with-typescript-and-webpack-6b221ebe5f10)
  - with the help of `@asmallstudio/plugin-react-static-css-modules-postcss-sass`

- classes correctly typed in VSCode and compilation time
- compatible with `post-css`
- using a fork `"typings-for-css-modules-loader": "https://github.com/andrezero/typings-for-css-modules-loader"
  - merged https://github.com/andrezero/typings-for-css-modules-loader/commit/a4971f0baa82fa129d511572aa9f027e0d55b175 - adds support for css-loader-2?

```json
"resolutions": {
  "react-static/css-loader": "1.0.1"
}
