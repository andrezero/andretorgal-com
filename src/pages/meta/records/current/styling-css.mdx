<Abstract>

I am [rebuilding my site with Astro](/posts/2023-01/building-my-website-with-astro-mdx-preact). Should I use any CSS pre-processing? Or are we good with _just_ CSS in 2023?

</Abstract>

## Decision :white_check_mark: All in

CSS is awesome. And Astro does a great a job of scoping it to your components, while providing the escape hatch needed for _those cases_.

Not a pun.

Seriously, it's been a long journey, I know. But it's been more than 2 decades, it had to grow, it had to evolve. We're in 2023, and CSS kind of just works (\*) these days.

_(\*) Almost always_

### Why

I want to use pure CSS as much as possible, but scoped as in "modules".

With [Astro](/meta/records/current/build-with-astro) you get, out of the box:

- zero config [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)
- absolutely scoped modules, you can't even use a `... > *:first-child` to override styles on children
- ability to escape the scoped modules and affect some global styles where it makes sense

Practical. No fuss.

See implementation details in [Styling](/meta/docs/styling).

:warning: pending a proper PostCSS configuration. See [browser support](/meta/records/pending/browser-support) for more details.
