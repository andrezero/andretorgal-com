## tl;dr

- CSS vars for the win
- Responsive and fluid scales for spacing and type
- Color schemes are not themes
- Color schemes can be more than just dark/light mode

## Foundational tokens

#### Space

- `--t-space-*` - using an [utopia space scale calculator](https://utopia.fyi/space/calculator/)

#### Typography:

- `--t-type-size-*` - using [utopia type scale calculator](https://utopia.fyi/type/calculator)
- `--t-type-*-` - basic set of families, weights, heights

#### Color

- colors: [4 simple proto palettes](/meta/docs/colour)
  - `--t-palette-white`
  - `--t-palette-red`
  - `--t-palette-cyan`
  - `--t-palette-black`

## Color schemes

- `--scheme-*` - 4 color schemes
  - base `::root` - the page, the `<main>` content
  - `cs-primary` - main header and site nav
  - `cs-secondary` - site section nav
  - `cs-tertiary` - site footer

Only 1 of the color schemes is overridden when `prefers-color-scheme: dark` and the `secondary`, and `tertiary` are merely tweaked as they are already pretty dark.

**Note:** I didn't consider adding theme support to this website.

## Layout tokens

The `--layout-*` are semantic tokens for organising scale and rhythm in a responsive way:

- `--layout-legroom` - top padding for page layouts
- `--layout-headroom` - bottom padding for page layouts

For horizontal spacing:

- `--layout-unit` - minimum space between atoms
- `--layout-gutter` - on small screens
- `--layout-gutter-min`

For vertical spacing:

- `--layout-unit` - minimum space between atoms
- `--layout-gap` - space between blocks
- `--layout-space` - between molecules
- `--layout-pause` - between page sections (organisms)

Along with some extra tokens for tweaking space proportionally, but with precision:

- `--layout-shift`
- `--layout-shift-fixed` - outline-offsets and thin borders should not be scalable
- `--layout-border-thin` - outline-offsets and thin borders should not be scalable

**Note:** Although I am using atomic design nomenclature in these docs, I decided to drop these from the components or tokens after. See [Conventions: atomic semantics](/meta/records/rejected/conventions-structure-atomic-semantics) to know why.
