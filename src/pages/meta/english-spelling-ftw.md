## Why

- ## Support for en-gb in tools is sometimes lacking

## Decision

Stick to :uk-flag: English like a stickler for

## Curious note

:explode: everyone but Cambridge thinks trade-off should be spelled.

- [Cambridge: tradeoff](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/trade-off)
- [Oxford: trade-off](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/trade-off_2?q=tradeoff)
- [Merriam Webster: trade-off](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trade-off)
- [macmillan: trade-off](https://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/trade-off_2)
- [Collins: trade-off](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/trade-off)

The free dictionary believes both [tradeoff](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/tradeoff) and [trade-off](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/trade-off) are :uk-flag: and :en-flag:.
