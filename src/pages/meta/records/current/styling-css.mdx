## Decision: pure CSS, scoped by Astro

CSS is awesome.

Not a pun.

### Why

I want to use pure CSS as much as possible, but scoped as in "modules".

With [Astro](/meta/records/current/build-with-astro) you get, out of the box:

- zero config [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)
- absolutely scoped modules, you can't even use a `... > *:first-child` to override styles on children
- ability to escape the scoped modules and affect some global styles where it makes sense

Practical. No fuss.

See implementation details in [Styling](/meta/docs/styling).
