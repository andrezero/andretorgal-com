## Status

@todo add links

Playwright proof of concept worked wonderfully locally but a CI POC is blocked.

- failed to install in Netlify
- no Github actions are not set up yet
- not even decided whether to [Netlify or S3](/meta/records/pending/hosting-netlify-or-s3).

## Decision: use playwright

- Astro components are not really unit testable
