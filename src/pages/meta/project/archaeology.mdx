<Abstract>

Previous incarnations of this website.

When, what, how? Which languages and frameworks?

</Abstract>

<Year y="2023" />

See the [docs section](/meta/docs/) for details on the current version (SSG with Astro).

## SSG days

For the past few years I have been running my website as a static build.

<Year y="2019-2022" />

The previous version was very similar to the current one. Also a [static site](/tags/ssg), but built with [React Static](/meta/records/rejected/react-static) + [SCSS](/meta/records/rejected/styling-sass-post-css).

![Screenshot of my website's about page back in 2019. It's black, while and red, and has a photo of me standing in front of a fake giant moon](../../posts/2019-06/media/andretorgal-com-2019.png)

- Roughly the same design as today.
- Also, a similar [information architecture](/meta/docs/information-architecture): pages, posts, tags, meta.
- All the content authored with [Markdown](/tags/markdown) and pseudo-[MDX](/tags/mdx).
- React is also running on the client-side and you can navigate without full page reloads.

<Year y="2016-2019" />

Already a [static site](/tags/ssg) back then, but built with my own [cool generator](https://github.com/andrezero/guay) joy: , something I had derived from the documentation websites I had built for 2 component libraries at work (Style guide driven development was all the rage).

- Markdown, parsed and rendered by my generator.
- Pure HTML/CSS and some [EJS](https://ejs.co/) templates.
- No JS running on the browser.
- Full static page reload on navigation.
- This is when I started using the black / red / white colour scheme I believe, as well as the moon picture.

## Dark ages of social media

<Year y="2009-2016" />

My online identity, presence, and content were entirely suppressed, :dizzy_face: swallowed bones and all, by the social networks for [reasons I explored in this post](/posts/2017-01/hello-world).

## Wordpress days

<Year y="2003-2009" />

Wordpress. Self-hosted on some [VPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server) provider? Why can't I remember, arghh... :sweat: I remember [Lighttpd](https://www.lighttpd.net/) and [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) though. At least a step up from Apache days.

At some point during these years I was running at least 2 or 3 websites at the same time:

- A blog about anything, including how to have fun processing laundry.
- A more professional site, where socks were not invited.
- Sociedade An√≥nima: a blog about street art in Portugal.

## Pre-history

<Year y="2000-2002" />

PHP custom stuff, built around Zend and/or Cake and/or something else always evolving. And hosted on some crappy [shared hosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_web_hosting_service) provider, managed via [cPanel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPanel).

Ohhh! I could we? I feel dirty just thinking how hacky and irresponsible the whole thing was.

Still is? :innocent:

<Year y="1998-2000" />

Pure static HTML + CSS + JS and one picture of a matrioska that I was sort of making my "brand".

Written in notepad, my first online CV looked like Flash without the Flash, but indeed with some impressive DHTML animations.

I wish I had some screenshots, let alone the code.

Also, FTP'ed with much :heart: and patience.

### How did it all start?

I have written a boring long page about [my story with computers and the internet](/about/story). You are invited to dig deeper.
