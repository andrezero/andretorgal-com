<Abstract>
Some days writing feels like climbing a muddy mountain. It takes way too much time and effort :sweat: to create something I’m even remotely satisfied with.

Can I somehow break this cycle and find a sustainable pace without these year-long interruptions? Or do I actually need another break?

</Abstract>

## Why I do even write?

It starts with a need to process my ideas and emotions. Finding the right words and shaping them into a coherent narrative feels deeply personal — it’s a conversation with myself.

But writing is also about sharing. Once those words are out there, they’re no longer just for me. They become a way to connect.

Friends occasionally read my posts and encourage me:

> You need to write more.

Eventually, complete strangers also stumble upon my work. Someone reached out once to ask questions about an article on [design systems](/posts/2023-02/benefits-of-design-systems/). Not only I learned that it was showing up in search results - strangely gratifying - I had the opportunity to connect with another human :hugging_face: with whom my post had deeply resonated.

It might all just start as a need to find clarity, to quiet the inner dialog by working mindfully on the words. But it also brings me connection, and the sense that maybe — just maybe — some of those words can be useful to others.

## What I struggle with

In a world buzzing with bots and AI, why should my words matter? Why not offload everything to ChatGPT and let it churn out polished prose?

The robot wrote that :point_up_2:. It is not my tone, my voice. Not even an attractive idea. Well, .. I guess I understand why the robot would suggest it. :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:

Part of my challenge is finding a voice — a consistent, authentic tone that reflects me. But that’s tricky when I write about so many things: [work topics](/tags/work), [music](/tags/music/), [personal reflections](/tags/personal), ... I feel like each topic demands a different tone, vocabulary, and focus.

Then there’s the internal noise: the voices in my head critiquing every word, the fear of boring my audience, and the nagging doubt that my English (not my first language) isn’t good enough.

> It's all about practice

Friends keep encouraging me and giving me tips. Following their wise advice, I restarted reading books consistently, expanding my vocabulary, beginning to appreciate writing styles I wasn't familiar with. I started practicing offline with writing techniques, writing down my dreams, the works...

But the pressure to get it “just right”, and the disconnection I typically end up feeling when reading the results, often saps the joy from the process.

It turns out that practicing writing is also hard :sweat_smile:

## Taking a break

Yep. I’m at that point again.

I need to stop thinking about this and take another one of those long breaks.

Maybe stepping away is part of the process — time to let ideas quietly grow in the background. Live it out. Invest more time into learning languages, drumming, and sports. Those are always guaranteed to deliver rewards.

And maybe, when I return, I’ll find the words waiting for me.

Until then, this is me hitting pause.
