<Note type="blog">

I blogged about this

- [(re)Building my website with Astro + MDX + Preact](/posts/2023-01/building-my-website-with-astro-mdx-preact).
- [Saying goodbye to my React Static website.](/posts/2023-01/saying-goodbye-to-my-react-static-website).

</Note>

## Why

- My website's core metrics have been degrading over the last 3 years. Not acceptable anymore
- [React Static](/meta/records/rejected/react-static) is in maintenance mode now, need to replace it with something more modern
- Could use the opportunity to dream up some exciting new features.
- I need a holiday project

## Decision: Rebuild the site with Astro

> [Astro](https://astro.build) is an all-in-one web framework for building fast, content-focused websites.

- :check: (extensible) Markdown & MDX support
- :check: Fully SSG first
- :check: with opt-in, micro client side _islands_
- :check: with opt-in route pre-fetching support
- :check: 100/100 Lighthouse performance
- :check: SEO-friendly with canonical URLs / OpenGraph
- :check: Sitemap support
- :check: RSS Feed support

## Trade-offs

Astro core maintainers seem to be very focused on "easy to use" use cases and the "non typescript person" out there. I can totally empathise with that and wish the best luck. Hopefully the opinionated parts of Astro don't get too much in the way fo building a more bare bones experience. Hopefully I can tag along for a while.

- :fingers-crossed: querying for data is not terribly optimised, let's see how this scales
- :sad: coupling URL with file-structure
- no (react) context available on SSG time - no miracles
- embracing `cjs` means some older tools may not be compatible, but let's embrace the future

## Other options considered

No serious contender.

### Next.js SSG

In Next.js, SSG is an afterthought. And an [advanced feature](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/static-html-export).

I already have to deal with this monster at work and I don't need the whole React stack for this web site, anyway, as I want to focus on content and IA, not interaction.

So, not dissing, Next.js is amazing and does the job well. At work.

### Gatsby

Gatsby was already bloating 3 years ago. Plus, I still don't find the GraphQL indirection comfortable.

No thanks.
